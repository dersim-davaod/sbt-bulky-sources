# Bulky sources plugin for SBT

## Overview


An [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org) (Simple Build Tool) plugin
that provides statistics about the size of source files in the sbt console.
Its purpose is to provide a Bird's-eye view of your project in terms of the size of source files.
Those files that are large or "bulky" are displayed, so the developer can treat that as a sort of warning.

## Installation

To add sbt-bulky-sources functionality to your project add the following to your project/plugins.sbt file:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("dersimdavaod.scalabootcamp" % "sbt-bulky-sources" % "0.1.0")
```

## Usage sbt-bulky-sources plugin

The sbt-bulky-sources plugin adds the `bulkySources` task to sbt, and is meant to be run from the sbt console.

To see the list of files that are "large", run the following command from sbt console:
```
sbt show bulkySources [threshold]
```

where the `threshold` defines how many lines the file should include at least to be treated as a "large" or "bulky".

### Examples:

```
sbt show bulkySources
```

Output:

```
[info] * (430, .../src/main/scala/../../../A.scala)
[info] * (130, .../src/main/scala/../../../B.scala)
[info] * (100, .../src/main/scala/../../../C.scala)
[info] * (500, .../src/main/scala/../../../D.scala)
```

```
show bulkySources 300
```

Output:

```
[info] * (430, .../src/main/scala/../../../A.scala)
[info] * (500, .../src/main/scala/../../../D.scala)
```

```
sbt show test:bulkySources 300
```

Output:

```
[info] * (500, .../src/main/scala/../../../D.scala)
```

## Testing

To test the plugin you can use sbt scripted tests framework,
which lets you script a build scenario.

The current projects includes [scripted-plugin](src/sbt-test/src-bulky-sources-plugin/smoke/test) that performs smoke tests.

To run the scripts, go back to your plugin project, and run:

```
> scripted
```

This will copy your test build into a temporary dir, and executes the test script.
If everything works out, youâ€™d see publishLocal running, then the result of testing.
